# Refractor Exercise

Introduction 

After taking a close look at the changes that needed to be made to Horiseon Company website I have concluded the work that was done was very necessary </p>
I'll start by introducing the syntax errors that were considerably prevalant in the HTML and CSS files  </p>

HTML Syntax
-There were a lot of organizationl errors that I cleaned up such as misplaced tags, redundant use of syntax, and pointless classes 
-After doing such the code was much easier to read and navigate around especially since I added semantic tags to make it easier to interpret 
-The file was cut down considerably and organized to a much better degree than it was before so if it does need more work in the future it will be easier to accomplish
-In addition to this I added notes throughout the page in order to make it easier to navigate

CSS Syntax
-The first thing I noticed was that the page was considerably long and was hard to interpret what exactly was doing what.
-After going through the page it was clear that many classes could be combined into one line since they shared the same characteristics so I did such.
-I also cleaned up the extra spaces in between to make it easier to read
-In conclusion the syntax wasn't terrible in and of itself, but the organization of it needed some work.

Conclusion:

  The changes that I made to the code will considerably help the company prosper as more people will be able to easily manuever around the page. The text is much more visible now, as before some of the items that seemed very important to be shown, were not appearing. This could be troublesome for potential clients visiting the site considering they would not able to get the information they are seeking. I believe this was an important task that needed to be accomplished and it  will further to help the company down the line as they won't have to worry about maintaining a healthy website as much as they did before.
