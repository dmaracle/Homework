<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> After taking a close look at the changes that needed to be made to Horiseon Company website I have some news to share. </p>
<p>  I'll start by introducing the syntax errors that were very prevalant in the HTML and CSS files  </p>

  <h2>  HTML </h2>
<li>
<p> There were a lot of organizationl errors that I cleaned up such as misplaced tags, redundant use of syntax, and pointless classes  </p>
<p> After doing such the code was much easier to read and navigate around especially since I added more semantic tags to make it easier to interpret </p>
<p> The file was cut down considerably and organized to a much better degree than it was before so if it does need more work in the future it will be easier to accomplish </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>  </p>
</li>
